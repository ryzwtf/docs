Our system will automatically detect if you have multiple accounts.

## Unban previously banned accounts

<Info>
Our **Multiaccounting Policy** changed on `5 August 2025`.  
This means old accounts that didn’t follow the policy can now be **unbanned on request**.
</Info>

<Update label="Old Policy">
    By using haunt.gg you agree **NOT** to:
    - Create multiple accounts, except your own premium or verified account, on every account.
</Update>

You can request an unban of your account by contacting us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hauntbio).
